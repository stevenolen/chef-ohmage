# ohmage flyway migrations

Welcome to the ohmage flyway migrations! [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org/) integration into ohmage is ongoing.
That doesn't mean you can't benefit though! Feel free to use these flyway migrations with the flyway executable to
intialize/seed an ohmage db! note the two flyway.placeholders (`fqdn` and `base_dir`) which will need to be updated in the database
directly if you haven't set them!
